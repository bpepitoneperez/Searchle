Basically a Wordle x Where's Waldo fusion

## About

Originally part of the coursework for The Odin Project to make a Where's Waldo website to learn Firebase and practice React, I thought making it a Wordle clone would be more interesting and fun.

Currently there are 7 images and 108 total characters in those images, with plans to add more in the future.

## Frontend

This frontend is built with React (bootstrapped with Create-React-App) and React-Router, with some react-bootstrap and other css for styling.

## Backend

The frontend pulls the image for the day from a Node.js api backend, which is connected to a MongoDB
